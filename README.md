# React Form Handler

## Objective

Build a React project to practice form handling and data submission. The form collects user input (name and email) and displays it in the parent component upon submission.

## Steps

1. Create a parent component (`App`) to manage the state of the submitted data.
2. Build a child component (`UserForm`) that contains the form.
3. Use `useState` to manage the input values locally.
4. Pass the submitted data to the parent component using props.

## Outcome

- The form collects user input and sends it to the parent component.
- The parent component displays the submitted data below the form.
